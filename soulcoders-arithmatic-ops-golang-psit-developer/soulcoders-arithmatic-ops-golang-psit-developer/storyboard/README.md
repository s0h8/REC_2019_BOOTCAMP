## Round 2

Experiment 1: Understanding and analysing syntax of Go programming in the context of Arithmetic operators.

### 1. Story Outline:

<div align="justify"> The experiment involves understanding syntax of Go Programming Language using arithmetic operators.The simulator takes input from student gives the result of each step of algorithm and let him understand each operation. 

### 2. Story:

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
<h2>Construction of the set-up</h2>

For better visualization, a simulator is provided. A simulation can always act as the best possible alternative to learn. the simulator is divided into three sections: <br>
➢	Operator Section: Helps in interacting with the  student (accepting  operator name from student).<br>
➢	Source Code Section: Displays the subsequent code for each type of choice the student takes to perform any operation.<br>
➢	Output Section: Displays the output that will be generated after the code runs successfully.

#### 2.2 Set Student Objectives & Goals:

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Student will be able to: <br>Describe basic syntax of Go programming language using arithmetic operators. | Understand | Describe
2.| Student will be able to: <br>Explain the algorithm for doing arithmetic operations in Go programming language.  | Understand| Explain
3.| Student will be able to: <br>Analyse the algorithm and enhance conceptual and logical skill. | Analyze | Analyse

</b>

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

The Simulator tab would allow:<br> <br>
<dd> 1. The setup consists of a simulator that helps in performing arithmetic operations with the use of Go Language<br>
    2. There will be three sections to work upon: Operator Section, Source Code Section and Output Section.<br>
    3. The code section will display the Program for the type of operation you want to perform.<br>
    4. The Output section shows the result of each instruction of the Algorithm.<br>
    5. Once the experiment has been performed,if Student wants assessment he/she has to click 'Program Task' button of the simulator that appears only after completing the simulator.<br>
    6. After Completion of given task, the result of the progress will be shown along with the feedback.

### 5. Storyboard 
<div align="justify">The experiment of the Lab includes a simulator that provides an interface to the student for understanding the syntax of Go Programming Language. The simulator is divide into three sections named as operator section, source code section and output section. Simulator uses arithmetic operators to illustrate an algorithm in Go Programming. The student is asked to select the Arithmetic operators and click the execute button in the simulator which will show the algorithm step.

<br>
<br>
<div align="justify">The simulator then start iterating the code that is shown in the source code and output section of the simulator. The code in the source code section is generated for every operation chosen by the student. After clicking the next instruction button the student sees the output of each step of the algorithm along with an explanation. If student wishes to go back to a previous instruction then student can click on previous button.

<div align="justify">During the line by line execution of the program, the student is asked to enter the value of operand (known as 'a' and 'b' in the simulator) and the result is shown in the output screen.

<br>
<div align="justify">As the student completes the simulator he can reset and make another choice of arithmetic operator and run the simulator again. And if he wishes to go to the assessment section he has to click 'Program Task' button of the simulator that appears only after completing the simulator.

<br>
<br>
<div align="justify">The Program Task section takes the student to the questions based on Go Programming language where the student has to fill the missing gaps in the code. The missing gaps in the program test the student's understanding of syntax. The student attempts the questions and after completing the questions, the student is allotted marks and a button appears to move back to simulator where if the student does not get satisfactory marks he can move back to the simulator to understand the concept once again
