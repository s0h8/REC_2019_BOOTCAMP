What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:-:
| Student will click on the Simulator tab. | Simulator will start along with three sections which are Operator section,Source code Section and Output Section  |<div align = "justify"> To start the Simulator.
| Student will hover on instruction button.  | Simulator will open instruction tab.  |<div align = "justify"> To make student familiar with the simulator.
| Student will click on the Dropdown menu.  | Simulator will show all the different arithmetic operations.  |<div align = "justify">To let Student select one of the operators.
| Student will click on the execute button. | Simulator will show the algorithm and program.  |<div align = "justify">  To display the program along with algorithm.
| Student will click on next instruction button.  | Simulator will show the working of next instruction on the Source code section of simulator.  |<div align = "justify"> Understand instruction of program step by step.
| Student may click on previous instruction button. | Simulator will show the working of previous instruction on the Source code section of simulator. |<div align = "justify">  Understand the working of program in an appropriate manner.
| Student will enter the inputs in program.  | Simulator will show the program query.  |<div align = "justify"> Identify the conceptual clarity of syntactical checking.
| Student may click on reset button.  | Simulator will restart.  |<div align = "justify"> To restart the simulator.
| Student will click on the Program Task button.  | Simulator will show the Task Page.  |<div align = "justify"> For better understanding of working of Go Language.
| Student will fill the missing blanks in the given task questions.  | Simulator will save the inputs.  |<div align = "justify"> For better understanding of different syntax of Go language.
