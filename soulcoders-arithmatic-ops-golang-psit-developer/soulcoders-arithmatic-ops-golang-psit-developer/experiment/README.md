### <b>Aim</b>
In this experiment the Student will be able to understand and analyse the syntax of Go programming language in context of Arithmetic Operations by using an simulator.

### <b>Theory</b>
 <h4>Principle:</h4>
                   <div align="justify"> It involves the use of Go simulator implementing various arithmetic operations. Understanding and Analysing the syntax of Go Programming Language can be a difficult job to accomplish. This difficulty can be countered with the help of Go simulator that provides a friendly programming environment to the beginners, so that every new Student can easily perform arithmetic operations and can implement in various Go programs. <br>
                    <h4>Theory of Arithmetic Operator:</h4>
                    Operators are the foundation of any programming language. Thus the functionality of the Go language is incomplete without the use of Arithmetic operators.<br>
                    These are used to perform arithmetic operations on operands in Go language:<br>
                    Addition: The ‘+’ operator adds two operands. For example, x+y.<br>
                    Subtraction: The ‘-‘ operator subtracts two operands. For example, x-y.<br>
                    Multiplication: The ‘*’ operator multiplies two operands. For example, x*y.<br>
                    Division: The ‘/’ operator divides the first operand by the second. For example, x/y.<br>
                    Modulus: The ‘%’ operator gives the remainder when first operand is divided by the second. For example, x%y. <br>
                    
### <b>Procedure</b>
<h4>Steps of simulator :</h4>
                    1. Click on the Simulator tab.<br>
                    2. Click on instruction button in simulator to see the steps for running simulator.<br>
                    3. Click on the dropdown to select arithmetic operator.<br>
                    4. Click on execute button.<br>
                    5. Click on next instruction button to see the execution of each step of program.<br>
                    6. To go to a previous instruction student can click on previous instruction button.<br>
                    9. Click on Program Task button that appears after program execution completes.<br>
                    10. After completing the programming task student can click on result button to see the result .<br>
                    11. The result section contains show answer button,clicking on it takes user to correct answer section.<br>
                    12. Click on reset button to run the simulator again.<br>
