### <b>Theory</b>
 <h3><b>Principle:</b></h3>
                   <div align="justify"> It involves the use of Go simulator implementing various arithmetic operations. Understanding and Analysing the syntax of Go Programming Language can be a difficult job to accomplish. This difficulty can be countered with the help of Go simulator that provides a friendly programming environment to the beginners, so that every new Student can easily perform arithmetic operations and can implement in various Go programs. <br>
                    <h3><b>Theory of Arithmetic Operator:</b></h3>
                    Operators are the foundation of any programming language. Thus the functionality of the Go language is incomplete without the use of Arithmetic operators.<br>
                    These are used to perform arithmetic operations on operands in Go language:<br>
                    Addition: The ‘+’ operator adds two operands. For example, x+y.<br>
                    Subtraction: The ‘-‘ operator subtracts two operands. For example, x-y.<br>
                    Multiplication: The ‘*’ operator multiplies two operands. For example, x*y.<br>
                    Division: The ‘/’ operator divides the first operand by the second. For example, x/y.<br>
                    Modulus: The ‘%’ operator gives the remainder when first operand is divided by the second. For example, x%y. <br>
