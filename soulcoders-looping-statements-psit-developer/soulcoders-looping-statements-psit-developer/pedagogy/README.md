###### <h4>3.2 Assessment Method : 
Formative

<b>Description: </b> The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfills our purpose.<br>
In this experiment student will learn the Looping Statements in Go Programming Language.
<br>
 <div align="justify">The simulator will iterate through each and every step of algorithm  which help student to understand the syntax of Go Programming and analyse the algorithm for Looping Statements.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Describe Looping Statements in Go Programming Language. | Student is asked to select Looping Statement from dropdown and click on execute button   | <div align="justify"> Which one of these is a looping construct in Go Programming Language?<br> 1. For<br>2. While<br>3. Do While<br>4. None of these<br>Are parentheses used in the for statement?<br> 1. Yes<br>2. No<br>3. Can't say<br>4. None of the these
2.| Explain the algorithm for using Looping Statements in Go programming language. | Student will click on next instruction button and see the explanation of each instruction line by line on output section  | <div align="justify">Which of these acts as a while loop  in Go Programming Language?<br>1. Do While<br>2. If<br>3. For<br>4. None of these<br> Is Infinite loop is possible?<br>1. Yes<br>2. No<br>3. Can't say<br>4. None of these
3.| Analyse the algorithm for Looping statements. | Student will write the missing part in code. | <div align = "justify"><p>Complete The Blanks using syntax Of Go Programming Language :</p><p><br>package main<br>import( "fmt" )<br>func main (){<br>var i,n int<br>var f int=1<br>n= ___ <br>for i=1;i<=5;i++<br> ____ <br>fmt.Print("Factorial Of 5 is : ",f)<br>}<br><br>package main<br>import( "fmt" )<br>func main (){<br>var sum,k int=0,0<br>for ____ k<5{<br> ____ <br>k++<br>}<br>fmt.Print("Sum Of first 5 Even Numbers Is : ",sum)<br>}</p>

<br>

What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:-:
| Student will click on the Simulator tab. | Simulator will start along with three sections which are Operator section,Source code Section and Output Section  |<div align = "justify"> To start the Simulator.
| Student will hover on instruction button.  | Simulator will open instruction tab.  |<div align = "justify"> To make student familiar with the simulator.
| Student will click on the Dropdown menu.  | Simulator will show all the different looping statements.  |<div align = "justify">To let Student select one of the operators.
| Student will click on the execute button. | Simulator will show the algorithm and program.  |<div align = "justify">  To display the program along with algorithm.
| Student will click on next instruction button.  | Simulator will show the working of next instruction on the Source code section of simulator.  |<div align = "justify"> Understand instruction of program step by step.
| Student will enter the inputs in program.  | Simulator will show the program query.  |<div align = "justify"> Identify the conceptual clarity of syntactical checking.
| Student may click on reset button.  | Simulator will restart.  |<div align = "justify"> To restart the simulator.
| Student will click on the Program Task button.  | Simulator will show the Task Page.  |<div align = "justify"> For better understanding of working of Looping statements in Go Language.
| Student will fill the missing blanks in the given task questions.  | Simulator will save the inputs.  |<div align = "justify"> For better understanding of looping statements in Go language.
| Student will click on the next button. | Simulator will show the next Test and marks will be saved.  |<div align = "justify"> For better understanding of looping statements in Go language.
| Student will finish the Task by filling all the blanks. | Simulator will show the result page.  |<div align = "justify"> For understanding the progress in learning.
