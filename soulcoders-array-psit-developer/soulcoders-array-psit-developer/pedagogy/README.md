Expository
###### <h4>3.2 Assessment Method : 
Formative

<b>Description: </b> The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfills our purpose.<br>
In this experiment student will learn the Arrays in Go Programming Language.
<br>
 <div align="justify">The simulator will iterate through each and every step of algorithm  which help student to understand the syntax of Go Programming and analyse the algorithm for Arrays.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Describe Arrays in Go Programming Language. | Student is asked to select type of array from dropdown and click on execute button   | <div align="justify">1. How does a 2 d array stores element ?<br><b>a.In form of matrix</b><br>b.In form of continous rows<br><br>2. A 2 d array is also known as-<br><b>a.multi dimensional array</b><br>b.row column array<br>3.multi directional array<br>4.none of these
2.| Explain the algorithm for using Arrays in Go programming language. | Student will click on next instruction button and see the output of each instruction line by line on output section  | <div align="justify">1. What does 0 , 1 is known as in a[0] and a[1]<br><b>a. index of array</b><br>b. values stored in array<br>c. memory location of array<br>d. none of these<br><br>2. How to declare a mutlidimensional array in Go Programming<br><b>a. var arrayName[length]Type</b><br>b. var Type arrayName[length]<br>c. Type arrayName[length]<br>d. none of these 
3.| Analyse the algorithm for Arrays. | Student will write the missing part in code. | <div align = "justify"><p>Complete The Blanks using syntax Of Go Programming Language :</p><p><br>1. Print fifth element of 2D array :<br>package main<br>import( "fmt" )<br>func main (){<br>var arr=[2][3]int{{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}<br>fmt.Print( ____ )<br>}<br><b>a[1][1]</b><br>2. Print the sum of diagonal elements of square matrix :<br>package main<br>import( "fmt" )<br>func main (){<br>var arr=[3][3]int{{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}}<br>fmt.Print( _____ )<br>}<b> ans: arr[0][0]+arr[1][1]+arr[2][2]</b></p>
