### <b>Aim</b>
In this experiment the Student will be able to understand and analyse the arrays in Go programming language by using the simulator.
### <b>Theory</b>
 <h3><b>Principle:</b></h3>
                   <div align="justify"> It involves the use of Go simulator implementing Array data structure. Understanding and Analysing Array in Go Programming Language can be a difficult job to accomplish. This difficulty can be countered with the help of Go simulator that provides a friendly programming environment to the beginners, so that every new Student can easily perform these data structure and can implement in various Go programs. <br>
                   Arrays are the most important part of Data Structure of any programming language. Thus the functionality of the Go language is incomplete without the use of Array.<br>
                    <h3><b>Theory of Array:</b></h3><br>
                    An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements. Typically these elements are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string. Arrays are commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.<br>
                    All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element. <br>
                    In our experiment we have discussed 1-D and 2-D Arrays. <br>
                    <b>One-Dimensional Array-</b><br>
                    <img src="experiment/images/arrays.PNG"> <br>
                    In the above image  200, 202, 204 are the memory location. and the 0,1,2 are the index of array.
                    A one-dimensional array (or single dimension array) is a type of linear array. Accessing its elements involves a single subscript which can either represent a row or column index.<br>
                    <b>Two-Dimensional Arrays -</b><br>
                    <img src="experiment/images/2darray.PNG"> <br>
                    A two-dimensional array is the simplest form of a multidimensional array. A two-dimensional array is, in essence, a list of one-dimensional arrays. To declare a two-dimensional integer array of size [x, y], you would write something as follows -<br>
                    syntax - var arrayName [ x ][ y ] variable_type<br>
                    
### <b>Procedure</b>
    1. Click on the Simulator tab.<br>
    2. Click on instruction button to know the steps to run simulator.<br>
    3. Click on the Drodpdown menu in simulator to select the type of array.<br>
    4. Enter the size of array the array.<br>
    5. Click on the execute button to run the program.<br>
    6. Click on next instruction button to see output of each step of program.<br>
    7. Click on Program Task button that appears after program execution completes.<br>
    8. After completing the programming task student can click on result button to see the result.<br>
    9. The result section contains show answer button,clicking on it takes user to correct answer section.<br>
    10. Click on reset button to run the simulator again.
