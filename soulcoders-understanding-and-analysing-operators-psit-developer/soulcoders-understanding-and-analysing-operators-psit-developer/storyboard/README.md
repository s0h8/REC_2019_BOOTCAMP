## Round 2

<b>Experiment 1:  Understanding & Analysing Relational and Logical Operators in Go Programming Language.</b>

### 1. Story Outline:

<div align="justify"> The experiment involves understanding Relational and Logical Operators in Go Programming Language.The simulator takes input from student which gives the result of each step of program and let him understand each operation. 

### 2. Story:

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
<h2>Construction of the set-up</h2>

For better visualization, a simulator is provided. A simulation can always act as the best possible alternative to learn. the simulator is divided into three sections: <br>
➢	Operator Section: Helps in interacting with the  student (accepting  operator name from student).<br>
➢	Source Code Section: Displays the subsequent code for each type of choice the student takes to perform any operation.<br>
➢	Output Section: Displays the output that will be generated after the code runs successfully.

#### 2.2 Set Student Objectives & Goals:

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Student will be able to: <br>Describe Relational Operators in Go Programming Language. | Understand | Describe
2.| Student will be able to: <br>Describe Logical Operators in Go Programming Language.  | Understand| Describe
3.| Student will be able to: <br>Analyse the algorithm and enhance conceptual and logical skill. | Analyze | Analyse

</b>

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

The Simulator tab would allow:<br>
<dd> 1. The setup consists of a simulator that helps in performing relational and logical operations with the use of Go Language<br>
    2. There will be three sections to work upon: Operator Section, Source Code Section and Output Section.<br>
    3. The source code section will display the Program for the type of operation you want to perform.<br>
    4. The Output section shows the result of each instruction of the Algorithm.<br>
    5. Once the experiment has been performed,if Student wants assessment he/she has to click 'Program Task' button of the simulator that appears only after completing the simulator.<br>
    6. After Completion of given task, the result of the progress will be shown along with the feedback.

### 5. Storyboard 
<div align="justify">The experiment of the Lab includes a simulator that provides an interface to the student for understanding the Relational and Logical operators in Go Programming Language. The simulator is divide into three sections named as operator section, source code section and output section. Simulator uses Relational and Logical operators to illustrate an algorithm in Go Programming. The student is asked to select one of the Relational or Logical operators and click the execute button in the simulator which will show the algorithm steps.

<br>
<br>
<div align="justify">The simulator then start iterating the code that is shown in the source code and output section of the simulator. The code in the source code section is generated for every operation chosen by the student. After clicking the next instruction button the student sees the output of each step of the program along with an explanation. If student wishes to go back to a previous instruction then student can click on previous button.

<div align="justify">During the line by line execution of the program, the student is asked to enter the value of operand (known as 'a' and 'b' in the simulator) and the result is shown in the output screen.

<br>
<div align="justify">As the student completes the simulator he can reset and make another choice of relational or logical operator and run the simulator again. There is a Program Task in simulator which appears when student click 'Program Task' button of the simulator that appears only after program execution is completed in simulator.

<br>
<br>
<div align="justify">The Program Task section takes the student to the questions based on Go Programming language where the student has to fill the missing gaps in the code. The missing gaps in the program test the student's understanding of usage of operators. The student attempts the questions and after completing the questions, the student is allotted marks and a button appears to move back to simulator where if the student does not get satisfactory marks he can move back to the simulator to understand the concept once again
