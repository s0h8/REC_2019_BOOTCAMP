Formative

<b>Description: </b>The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfills our purpose.<br>
 <div align="justify">In this experiment student will be able to understand the Relational and Logical Operators in Go Programming Language.<br>
 The simulator will iterate through each and every step of algorithm  which helps student to understand the operators.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Describe Relational Operators in Go Programming Language. | Student is asked to select Relational operators from dropdown and click on execute button   | <div align="justify"> How many different types of Relational Operators are used in Go Programming Language? <br> 1. 5<br>2. 4<br>3. 6<br>4. 2<br>Which of the following is not a relational operator?<br>1. ==<br>2. >=<br>3. !=<br>4. None of them.
2.| Describe Logical Operators in Go Programming Language. | Student is asked to select Logical operators from dropdown and click on execute button  | <div align="justify"> how many different types of Logical Operators are used in Go Programming Language?<br>1. 4<br>2. 3<br>3. 2<br>4. 1<br>The syntax for using && is-<br>1. cmd1 && cmd2<br>2.cmd1 cmd2 &&<br>3. cmd1 & cmd2&<br>4.None of them.
3.| Analyse the Program and enhance conceptual and logical skill. | Student will write the missing part in code. | <div align = "justify"><p>Complete The Blanks using syntax Of Go Programming Language :</p><p><br>package main<br>import( _____ )<br>func _____ (){<br>var p,q int<br>p=45<br>q=80<br>if(p!=q && p<=q){<br>fmt. _____ ("True")<br>}<br><br>Complete The Blanks using syntax Of Go Programming Language :<br><br>package main<br>import ("fmt") func main(){<br>var i,j ____ = 5,4<br>if ____ {<br>fmt.Print("i is greater than j")<br>}else{<br>fmt.Print("i is not greater than j")}<br>}</p>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:-:
| Student will click on the Simulator tab. | Simulator will start along with three sections which are Operator section,Source code Section and Output Section  |<div align = "justify"> To start the Simulator.
| Student will hover on instruction button.  | Simulator will open instruction tab.  |<div align = "justify"> To make student familiar with the simulator.
| Student will click on the Dropdown menu and ask to select one of the operator.  | Simulator will show Relational and Logical operator in dropdown.  |<div align = "justify">To let Student select one of the operators.
| Student will click on the Dropdown menu. | Simulator will show either all Relational or Logical opertors.  |<div align = "justify"> To let Student select one of the Relational or Logical operator.
| Student will click on the Execute button. | Simulator will show the algorithm and program.  |<div align = "justify">  To display the program along with algorithm.
| Student will click on next instruction button.  | Simulator will show the working of next instruction on the Source code section of simulator.  |<div align = "justify"> Understand instruction of program step by step.
| Student may click on previous instruction button. | Simulator will show the working of previous instruction on the Source code section of simulator. |<div align = "justify">  Understand the working of program in an appropriate manner.
| Student will enter the inputs in program.  | Simulator will show the program query.  |<div align = "justify"> Identify the conceptual clarity of syntactical checking.
| Student may click on reset button.  | Simulator will restart.  |<div align = "justify"> To restart the simulator.
| Student will click on the Program Task button.  | Simulator will show the Task page.  |<div align = "justify"> For better understanding of working of Relational and Logical operators in Go Programming Language.
| Student will fill the missing blanks in the given Task.  | Simulator will save the inputs.  |<div align = "justify"> For better understanding of different operators in Go Programming Language.
| Student will click on the next button. | Simulator will show the next Task and marks will be saved.  |<div align = "justify"> For better understanding of different operators in Go Programming Language.
| Student will finish the Task by filling all the blanks. | Simulator will show the result page.  |<div align = "justify"> For understaing the progress in learning.
