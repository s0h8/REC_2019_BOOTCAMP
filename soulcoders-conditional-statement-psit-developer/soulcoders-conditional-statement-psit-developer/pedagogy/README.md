###### <h4>3.1 Instructional Strategy:     
Expository
###### <h4>3.2 Assessment Method : 
Formative

<b>Description: </b> The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfills our purpose.<br>
In this experiment student will learn the Conditional Statements in Go Programming Language.
<br>
 <div align="justify">The simulator will iterate through each and every step of algorithm  which help student to understand the syntax of Go Programming and analysing the algorithm for Conditional Statements.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Describe Conditional Statements in Go Programming Language. | Student is asked to select Conditional Statement from dropdown and click on execute button   | <div align="justify"> How many different types of Conditional Statements are used in Go Programming Language?<br> 1. 3<br>2. 5<br>3. 4<br>4. 6<br>Which of the following is not a conditional statement?<br> 1. If statement<br>2. If-Else statement<br>3. Switch statement<br>4. Goto statement
2.| Explain the algorithm for using Conditional Statements in Go programming language. | Student will click on next instruction button and see the explanation of each instruction line by line on output section  | <div align="justify">Is Default keyword is mandatory in switch statement?<br>1. Yes<br>2. No<br>3. Can't say<br>4. None of these<br> Is Break keyword is mandatory in switch statement?<br>1. Yes<br>2. No<br>3. Can't say<br>4. None of these
3.| Analyse the algorithm for conditional statements. | Student will write the missing part in code. | <div align = "justify"><p>Complete The Blanks using syntax Of Go Programming Language :</p><p><br>package main<br>import( "fmt" )<br>func _____ (){<br>var a int=20<br>if( _____ ){<br>fmt. _____ (""a is Greater Than 20"")<br>}<br><br>package main<br>import( _____ )<br>func main (){<br>var a,b,c int=5,8,7<br>if( ____ ){<br>if( _____ ){<br>fmt.Print("a is greatest")<br>}<br>}</p>

<br>

What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:-:
| Student will click on the Simulator tab. | Simulator will start along with three sections which are Operator section,Source code Section and Output Section  |<div align = "justify"> To start the Simulator.
| Student will hover on instruction button.  | Simulator will open instruction tab.  |<div align = "justify"> To make student familiar with the simulator.
| Student will click on the Dropdown menu.  | Simulator will show all the different conditional statements.  |<div align = "justify">To let Student select one of the operators.
| Student will click on the execute button. | Simulator will show the algorithm and program.  |<div align = "justify">  To display the program along with algorithm.
| Student will click on next instruction button.  | Simulator will show the working of next instruction on the Source code section of simulator.  |<div align = "justify"> Understand instruction of program step by step.
| Student may click on previous instruction button. | Simulator will show the working of previous instruction on the Source code section of simulator. |<div align = "justify">  Understand the working of program in an appropriate manner.
| Student will enter the inputs in program.  | Simulator will show the program query.  |<div align = "justify"> Identify the conceptual clarity of syntactical checking.
| Student may click on reset button.  | Simulator will restart.  |<div align = "justify"> To restart the simulator.
| Student will click on the Program Task button.  | Simulator will show the Task Page.  |<div align = "justify"> For better understanding of working of conditional statements in Go Language.
| Student will fill the missing blanks in the given task questions.  | Simulator will save the inputs.  |<div align = "justify"> For better understanding of conditional statements in Go language.
| Student will click on the next button. | Simulator will show the next Test and marks will be saved.  |<div align = "justify"> For better understanding of conditional statements in Go language.
| Student will finish the Task by filling all the blanks. | Simulator will show the result page.  |<div align = "justify"> For understanding the progress in learning.
